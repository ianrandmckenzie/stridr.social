                          <p><strong>Disclaimer And Non-Waiver of Rights</strong></p>
                          <p>Stridr makes no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind as regards the website and associated technology. Any purportedly applicable warranties, terms and conditions are excluded, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; basis.

In such cases, the provincial law shall apply to the extent necessary.</p>

                          <p>As set out, above, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.
