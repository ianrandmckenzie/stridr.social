# STRIDR

Stridr brings everything you like on social media and presents it in once place, plus suggests additional social profiles you may like.

This project is a culmination of multiple self-driven/combined class projects of creating not only a minimum viable product app, but minimum viable product tech business. After an impressive start garnering an invitation to the BC Venture Acceleration Program, this project was eventually shut down due to the tumultuous environment of social app APIs generated by several controversies around social media in 2016/2017 â€” combined with the fact that a sole developer (and business operator) was responsible for the management of multiple social API integrations.
